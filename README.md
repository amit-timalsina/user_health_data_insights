# Rolling Insights - 7-Day Health Analytics

A tool that analyzes 7 consecutive days of health data to generate insights on sleep patterns, phone usage, and health metrics.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rolling-insights
```

Make a virtual env. Then,
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

1. Create .env file based on `.env.example`.
2. Run the script to generate insights:

```bash
python build_insights.py --input INPUT_JSON_FILE_PATH
```

This processes the data in `samples/` and outputs three JSON files to the `insights/` directory:
- `sleepInsights.json` - Analysis of deep sleep, REM, efficiency, and latency
- `phoneUsage.json` - Screen time, pickups, and sleep impact analysis
- `healthInsights.json` - Vitals, activity load, and recovery analysis

## LLM Method

This project uses OpenAI's API to generate narrative insights. The system:
1. Extracts and calculates statistics from raw health data
2. Identifies correlations between metrics
3. Sends these statistics to the LLM with specialized prompts
4. Formats the responses into meaningful insights

Environment variables for LLM integration:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4.1
```

## Features

- Processes 7 consecutive nights of health data
- Outputs three insight payloads:
  - `sleepInsights.json` - Deep sleep, REM, efficiency, latency analysis
  - `phoneUsage.json` - Screen time, pickups, overlap analysis
  - `healthInsights.json` - Vitals, activity load, recovery analysis
- AI-generated narrative insights using OpenAI's GPT models
- Hybrid architecture implementation for maintainability and intuitive organization

## Output Samples

Each generated insight file contains:
- Period information (start/end date)
- Statistical metrics
- Daily data points
- Narrative insights generated by AI

Example of sleepInsights.json:
```json
{
  "period": {
    "start_date": "2025-03-24",
    "end_date": "2025-03-30"
  },

    "avg_total_sleep_minutes": 451.71,
    "avg_deep_sleep_minutes": 135.57,
    "avg_rem_sleep_minutes": 90.29,
    "avg_light_sleep_minutes": 225.86,
    "avg_sleep_efficiency": 0.92,
    "min_total_sleep_minutes": 420,
    "max_total_sleep_minutes": 510,
    "deep_sleep_percentage": 30.01,
    "rem_sleep_percentage": 19.99,
    "light_sleep_percentage": 50.00
  },
  "daily_data": [...],
  "narrative_insights": "Your deep sleep duration of 135 minutes per night exceeds the adult average of 90 minutes, suggesting excellent slow-wave sleep that contributes to memory consolidation and cellular repair. Your sleep efficiency of 92% is exceptional, indicating minimal disruptions once asleep..."
}
